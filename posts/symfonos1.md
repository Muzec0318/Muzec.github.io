Preparing for the OSCP examination so am going after OSCP like machines to improve on my enumeration skills and exploitation don't want to miss anything on the day of the exam XD feel free to jump in [Download Symfonos 1 Here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/symfonos-1,322/) .

We always start with an nmap scan.....

```
nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 -oA nmap/allports -v IP
```

```

```

Now that is more better we some interesting ports to look into but let start with the enumeration of SMB since it the low hanging fruit now let see what we can loot on it.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ smbclient -L //172.16.109.132/ -N          

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------

```
Now seems we have anonymous share which we can be access with no credentilas let try it.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ smbclient  //172.16.109.132/anonymous -N

Seems we got a txt file let download it to our attacking machine. And see what we have.

```
                                                                                                                                                                       
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ cat attention.txt  

Can users please stop using passwords like 'epidioko', 'qwerty' and 'baseball'! 

Next person I find using one of these passwords will be fired!

```

Now that is interesting if i remember clearly we still have a share owned by `helios` let try using the password we got now to see if user `helios` also fall victim of using weak password.

Boom we hit the bull eye `helios` password is `qwerty` now let get the files.

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(muzecã‰¿Muzec-Security)-[~/Documents/Vulnhubs/symfonos1]
â””â”€$ cat research.txt todo.txt
Helios (also Helius) was the god of the Sun in Greek mythology. He was thought to ride a golden chariot which brought the Sun across the skies each day from the east (Ethiopia) to the west (Hesperides) while at night he did the return journey in leisurely fashion lounging in a golden cup. The god was famously the subject of the Colossus of Rhodes, the giant bronze statue considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

1. Binge watch Dexter
2. Dance
3. Work on /h3l105

```

Now i `cat` both files and seems we found a hidden directory let try accessing it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156554843-ef0c9058-702f-444c-9f98-c9e555166207.png)

Now that is interesting seems we re dealing with wordpress we can easily use `wpscan` to enumerate it more .

```
wpscan --url http://symfonos.local/h3l105/ --plugins-detection passive
```

```

Now that is interesting look go through the plugins we just found.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69868171/156556885-c868fafe-979f-4e61-aee7-d9f4cd22935d.png)

Now that is some old plugins let do research on it if it vulnerable.
