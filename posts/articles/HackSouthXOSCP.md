_**My Experience with HackSouth to Get the OSCP Voucher X My OSCP Journey**_


- WhoAmI?:- 

Hey there, my name is Saminu Musa Saminu, but I usually go by `Muzec`. I'm a big fan of the TV show "Mr. Robot," which I believe is one of the reasons why I got interested in hacking in the first place.

I'm an offensive security engineer with four years of experience in cybersecurity. I have a strong passion for penetration testing, bug hunting, CTFs, and other security-related topics. I'm always fascinated by how things are built and how they can be broken, which is why I mostly spend my free time researching and trying to pwn machines on various platforms like PwnTillDawn, HackTheBox, TryHackMe, EchoCTF.Red, HackMyVm, ProvingGrounds, and several others.

I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the cybersecurity field, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills.
