_**My Experience with HackSouth to Get the OSCP Voucher X My OSCP Journey**_


- WhoAmI?:- 

Hey there, my name is Saminu Musa Saminu, but I usually go by `Muzec`. I'm a big fan of the TV show "Mr. Robot," which I believe is one of the reasons why I got interested in hacking in the first place.

I'm an offensive security engineer with four years of experience in cybersecurity. I have a strong passion for penetration testing, bug hunting, CTFs, and other security-related topics. I'm always fascinated by how things are built and how they can be broken, which is why I mostly spend my free time researching and trying to pwn machines on various platforms like PwnTillDawn, HackTheBox, TryHackMe, EchoCTF.Red, HackMyVm, ProvingGrounds, and several others.

I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the cybersecurity field, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills.


- My Experience with HackSouth to Get the OSCP Voucher:- 

My experience with HackSouth was nothing short of incredible. As someone with a growing interest in cybersecurity, I was very excited to participate in the [Pay It Forward(PIF) Program](https://hacksouth.africa/community/Pay-It-Forward/).

Hack South is a South African based collective of infosec professionals, security researchers and students. Coming together to share insight, advice and guidance to solve modern day security challenges. Without wasting to much of time let jump to the requirements already.

The OSCP voucher includes 90 days of lab time, course PDFs and videos, and one exam voucher. Obtaining it is easy and straightforward, with HackSouth providing excellent preparation for the OSCP exam. Furthermore, the requirement includes a report writing utilizing the OSCP exam template, which is very beneficial. Isn't that great?"

Steps:- 

1. MOTIVATION 

We want to know a bit about you, why do you want to get your OSCP? We also need to know more about how you meet the requirements above. You can email this through to `the-munx@protonmail.com`.
          
  _I remember drafting my email at 10PM at night, and I ended up going through the requirements over and over again to make sure I didn't miss               anything in my email. After clicking the send button, I was hoping that it would take a while to receive a reply. However, I was surprised                 when I received a response the next day._
