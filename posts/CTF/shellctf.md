So we downloaded the png file but it was a strange one thou but looking at the png file name it's said Wakanda_Translator. I quickly rush to my browser and search for Wakanda Translator cipher online.

Using this site https://www.dcode.fr/wakanda-alphabet I was able to decrypt the msg and got our flag.

First of all I rush to google and search about birds cipher online to check maybe I can get anything but guess what we where able to find one by using this this link https://www.dcode.fr/birds-on-a-wire-cipher.

We all know that this is a Morse code cipher but that's not the end of the encryption. Let check it out and see what we are going to get, So I decided to use online tools called Cyberchef.com.

Hmmm interesting I think we got a number when decrypting the Morse code and that number look like an SMS phone code. So quickly search for SMS phone code cipher online and I got one using this link https://www.dcode.fr/multitap-abc-cipher.
